# Development Setup

## Prerequisites

* JDK 1.8 or later (only required when building with Maven)
* node.js 10.5.x
* npm 6.1.x

## Build & run with Maven

### Build

1. Execute `./mvnw clean install`.

To make IntelliJ IDEA use Maven Wrapper by default, install and enable the following plugin:
* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10633-maven-wrapper-support

### Build without tests

* To skip unit tests, execute `./mvnw clean install -DskipTests`.
* To skip integration and UI E2E tests, execute `./mvnw clean install -DskipITs`.
* To skip all tests, execute `./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs`.

### Build incl. app docker image

1. First authenticate locally against the internal docker repository as follows: `docker login alvch-dockerv2-local.jfrog.io`.
    * Once executed, the credentials will be stored permanently in your docker config file.
    * For credentials, ask project team members.
1. To build and push the image, execute `./mvnw clean install -Pdocker`
    * If you want skip pushing images, add the following property: *-Ddockerfile.push.skip*

Please note, that pushing docker images locally is usually not needed. It will be performed by the CICD toolchain automatically.

### Run app JAR

1. Execute `java -jar alv-portal-webapp/target/alv-portal-webapp-<project.version>.jar --spring.profiles.active=local`
1. Verify that the application is running by visiting the following URL: _http://localhost:8080_.

In case you want to run the application locally and enable Spring Cloud capabilities:
1. First start all dependencies (will start JHipster registry as docker image): `docker-compose -f alv-portal-webapp/src/docker/local-cloud/docker-compose-deps.yml up -d`
    * Make sure the JHipster Registry has started locally at _http://localhost:8761/_ (credentials: _admin/admin_).
1. Run the app as follows: `java -jar alv-portal-webapp/target/alv-portal-webapp-<project.version>.jar --spring.cloud.config.uri=http://admin:admin@localhost:8761/config`
    * Now the portal application should be registered in JHipster Registry (see "Instances" in the web console).

### Run app docker image

1. Execute `docker run -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local -p 8080:8080 alvch-dockerv2-local.jfrog.io/portal:<project.version>`.   
1. Verify that the application is running by visiting the following URL: _http://localhost:8080_.

### Run app docker image with docker-compose

1. First build the project with _docker_ Maven profile (_-Pdocker_).
1. Start one of the available compose files:
    * local setup without spring cloud: `docker-compose -f alv-portal-webapp/target/docker-local-dist/docker-compose.yml up`
    * local setup incl. spring cloud: `docker-compose -f alv-portal-webapp/target/docker-local-cloud-dist/docker-compose-all.yml up`
         * Make sure you use compose files from the _/target_ directory (because of maven variables filtering)

## Build & run with Angular CLI (for local development) 

Before executing any of the following commands:
1. Switch to the **alv-portal-ui** directory.
1. Install NPM dependencies by executing `npm install` command.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the _target/dist_ directory.
* If you don't have installed _ng_ client globally, replace _ng_ command with a full path as follows: `node_modules/.bin/ng build`

### Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Run development server with Angular CLI

Run `npm run start:staging` for a dev server which connects to staging. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run start:local` for a dev server which connects to local instances of the different microservices. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Use local development server with User from Staging
In order to use the local development server running under `http://localhost:4200/` with an user from staging environment that has a certain role you have to do following steps: 
1. make sure that the ui connects to the staging-backend. Thus following config needs to be present in `alv-portal-ui/proxy.conf.json`:  
    ```  
    "/api/*": {
        "target": "https://staging.job-room.ch",  
        "secure": false,  
        "loglevel": "debug"  
    }
    ```
1. Login on staging [https://staging.job-room.ch/alv-portal-webapp/](https://staging.job-room.ch/alv-portal-webapp/) with the desired user (via eIAM).
1. After successful login you have to copy the the _bearer token_ from the session storage. Open the dev-console (F12 in most browsers) and go to the section "application/session storage". There you should find a key-value entry with the key `authenticationToken` and value something like this: `Bearer xyzAbd-iengfi293jueoen...`. Copy this value.
1. Open a new tab/window and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). There you can open the dev-console and enter `sessionStorage.setItem('authenticationToken', '<paste value here>');` and paste the value you copied before.
1. Hit F5 to refresh the page and check if you are logged-in as the desired user. The name of the user should appear at the right end of the menu bar at the top.
